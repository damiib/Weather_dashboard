# Weather_dashboard

## Tech Used
dayjs
api
javacript
html
css
//created a weather dash board to give the temperature of different cities.  This is a 5 day weather dashboard. I used api's to create the weather and the time.  I did not use moment, instead, I used dayjas for the date.  After adding the city in the search bar, it will give you the weather and then it saves the data.  To populate the weather data, an api was used.
